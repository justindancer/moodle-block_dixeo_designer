# Dixeo Course Designer for Moodle LMS

Effortlessly create complete Moodle courses using the power of AI. The **Dixeo Course Designer** helps administrators and educators turn a simple course description and optional supporting files into a fully functional, ready-to-use Moodle course in just a few clicks.

This plugin generates your course on Dixeo.com and automatically configures your Moodle platform to access it via LTI.

You can also create a [free Dixeo account](https://dixeo.com/login/signup.php) to start building courses directly.

**Developers:** plugin layout (PHP namespaces, externals, AMD modules) is documented in [`classes/README.md`](classes/README.md) and [`amd/README.md`](amd/README.md). Ongoing quality work is tracked in [`docs/QUALITY.md`](docs/QUALITY.md).
